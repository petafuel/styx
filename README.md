# Styx

A Berlin Group NextGenPSD2-compliant XS2A client.

## About

The Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) is intended to harmonise digital payment transactions within the European Economic Area. In addition to banks, PSD2 also provides many opportunities for third-party service providers (TTPs) to offer innovative services through the payment services provided by banks. Although PSD2 is based on a standard for bank interfaces, there remains considerable scope for implementation. For TTPs, developing and maintaining an XS2A interface is a time-consuming challenge. With the PSD2 XS2A Client Styx we offer TTPs a free and easy solution to interact with the different PSD2 interfaces of banks from Germany and Europe.

## Features

* Payment initiation service (PIS)
* Account information service (AIS)
* Confirmation of funds service (PIIS)
* SCA methods (redirect, OAuth2, decoupled, embedded)
